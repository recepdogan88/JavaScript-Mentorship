/**
 (Cost of shipping) A shipping company uses the following function to calculate the cost (in dollars) of shipping based on the weight of the package (in pounds).(10mins)

Price (＄)    Weight (lb)
(each pound)
3.5             0< w <= 1
5.5             1< w <= 3
8.5             3< w <= 10
10.5            10< w <= 20

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the weight of the package and display the shipping cost. If the weight is greater than 20, display a message “the package cannot be shipped.”
